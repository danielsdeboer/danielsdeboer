        <h1>I love making wonderful things that work everywhere</h1>

        <p>I'm a huge fan of taking well-supported and understood technologies and applying them to beautiful, function design. I love hand-crafting something exceptional that works everywhere.</p>

        <p>But most of all I love learning. I started writing code for the web over 10 years ago, and despite a few detours into unrelated fields, I've kept up with the state of the art. More than anything I love to try new things. (My search history is something like 40% StackOverflow.)</p>

        <p>In my limited spare time I like to write fiction, make and play music, cook, hang out with my Boston Terrier, manage my corporation in EVE Online, explore the city, drink really good coffee, talk about drinking really good coffee, talk about making really good coffee, and drink the Scotchiest Scotch I can find.</p>

        <h1>HTML, my first love</h1>
        
        <p>I've been working with HTML since... well, a long time ago. Before HTML versions had logos, semantics, and stylesheets. Before Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. For a while I even developed in XHTML. (Though those dark days are thankfully over.) My parents tell me I wrote my first HTML document as a toddler. True? I like to think so.</p>
        
        <p>Since then I've quit using notepad.exe to write webpages (Sublime 3 is my jam!), gained a deep understanding of CSS (and sped up my design implementation times with SASS), and learned how to make HTML's DOM jump through hoops with Javascript &amp; JQuery, </p>

        <h1>How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The CSS</h1>

        <p>I'll be honest with you. For a while I didn't really <em>get</em> CSS. Everything I tried to do was super-hard and stuff didn't do what I wanted to and things like <code>position: absolute</code> were some kind of inscrutable black magic (I know, I know)...</p>

        <p>Until one of my developer friends passed me a draft copy of a book called CSS In Action. Suddenly it all clicked. Positions, inheritance, specificity, pseudo-classes, displays, media queries all made sense.

        <p>But that's history. Now I use CSS the way it was intended (and a few ways it wasn't), all to make pages that look great everywhere. I don't know if I'm exactly a CSS guru, but I'm at least a CSS sensei.</p>

        <h1>PHP &amp; MySQL</h1>

        <p>I came to PHP from an odd angle. I was trying to design a report for a piece of accounting software, but the software was too limited to do what I wanted.</p>

        <p>Then I had a flash of inspiration: I have access to the database! I'll just set up a LAMP server and do it myself...</p>

        <p>A few years later, I've taken an MIT OpenCourseWare CompSci course, taken up Object Oriented programming, learned MVC principles, designed and written two full custom business applications, and done some delightfully silly side projects (like the HTML parser that take apart and stores the document as a custom-schema, JSON-encoded flat file and then puts it back together again... for absolutely no reason).</p>

      <section>
        <h1>All this and more!</h1>
        <p>I'll try to keep this brief, as I've done many, many things in my life so far. I have:</p>
        <p>Deep experience administering and running Wordpress, including building custom themes and doing funky things with taxonomies. I've procured, set up, and administered LAMP servers (Debian) in a corporate environment for over five years. I've been an IT Manager for several years, as well being responsible for troubleshooting just about everything under the sun (seriously, from embedded Fanuc robotic controllers to NAS raid arrays). I'm good with image editing, page layout, even some casual copy editing. I've administered Windows, Mac, and Linux (!) desktops in a mixed environment.</p>
        <p>Plus I'm tucking into a few new things right now: AngularJS, React, Polymer, Postgres, and Node.JS.</p>

        <h1>... Or your money back</h1>
        <p>I spent a bunch of time poking and prodding this site in just about every way you can imagine... but I bet there's something I missed.</p>

        <p>So here's the deal. If you can break this site (reasonably, not running it on your toaster or a Sopwith Camel or IE8), I'll buy you a beer. Seriously. But you have to come get it, I'm not driving to Orlando or anything.</p>
